# Driver-Drowsiness-detection-using-opencv
      Drivers often feel very drowsy while continuously driving for long distances without taking
breaks. Drowsiness is a major factor in increasing the chances for a vehicle to meet accidents
. According to various studies, Number of accidents caused by drowsiness is much higher
than the number of accidents caused by drunk driving. The number of accidents caused by
drowsiness can be reduced by having a proper system that can detect drowsiness, alert the
driver and prevent major injuries. It needs a proper system that will alert drivers to prevent
major injuries. The project starts an alarm when it detects the driver is drowsy and notify
drivers to take a rest along with a nearby rest services area. It detects the driverâ€™s last sleeping
time and suggests to take a rest.
